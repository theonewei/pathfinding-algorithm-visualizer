# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

> Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer is a visualizer to demonstrate how to find a path between a start node and an end node in a graph (bet you didn't see that coming). Each box on the screen represents a node. After selecting which algorithm you want to visualize, select a speed and then let the application run. This can help you understand the order and patterns that the algorithm uses to search each node. Its also very relaxing to watch if you just need to destress. I'd recommend max speed and no walls if you are into that.

## Technologies

> * Javascript for handling sorting logic and rendering
> * Webpack for bundling files

## Features/MVPS

>  1. Users can press visualize in order to see an algorithm demonstrated on the grid
> 2. Users can visualize advanced advanced pathfinding algorithms such as A* and Greedy Best First search which utilize heuristics
> 3. Users can control the speed at which the visualization executes
> 4. BONUS: Users can add walls/create mazes

## Timeline

* Monday: Setup project by arranging file structure and getting webpack running. Get nodes to show up on the screen. If needed use D3 to make it look good. Get comfortable manipulating nodes and getting them to display properly
* Tuesday: Implement first algorithm, Breadth First Search and get it to display properly along with a variable and maybe a simple controller for controlling speed.
* Wednesday: Add controls and explanations to the left side of the page. Style everything so that there's a complete application with just one algorithm.
* Thursday: Add Depth-first Search, Djikstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Greedy Best-First Search. Create a dropdown menu for selecting search algorithms.
* Friday: Add walls, Swarm Algorithm and it's variants. Walls will be implemented by clicking on nodes to turn them into wall nodes. Deploy to Github Pages.
